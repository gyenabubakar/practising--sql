# practising--postgres

I intend to solve all the exercises on [pgexercises.com](https://pgexercises.com/) in 4 ways, with:

- [ ] PostgreSQL
- [ ] DrizzleORM
- [ ] Prisma
- [ ] SQLite (still not sure if this is necessary)

I'll create folders for each of them, with each folder containing the solution to all the exercises.

Inside [clubdata.sql](./clubdata.sql) is the base data that pgexercises.com uses for all the exercises. I've added it here to maintain the exact data structure as at the time I solve these exercises.
